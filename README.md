# The Committee

The Committee is a web application for running large meetings under parliamentary procedure. It was built for my senior capstone project for my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Information Science from Northeastern University. The project involved a long design phase and a formal study to evaluate the software. The final report is ongoing, but will be attached here once complete.

Note that this software is a prototype and has some major limitations, especially in the front end application. It does not support the full range of features required for complex parliamentary procedure.

## Technical Details

The Committee consists of two parts, the frontend application that runs in the user's browser, and the backend application that runs on the server. The backend is written in TypeScript using Express for the RESTful interface and Mongoose to communicate with a MongoDB instance. The frontend is written using React and ES6. The tooling for the frontend is that provided by create-react-app.

Both packages are managed in this monorepo using Lerna.
